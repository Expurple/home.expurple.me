Hi! My name is Dmitrii Aleksandrov, I usually use `@expurple` handle.

# Trivia

- I always know my age, because I was born in early 2000 💡

  to [Tbilisi, Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi) in 2022 ✈️
- My native language is Russian. But I rarely use it online, unless I
  specifically need local info 🌐
