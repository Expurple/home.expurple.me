## About

This page lists every band that I've liked since I created the first version of
this list many years ago.

I find it more compact and reliable than keeping track on a streaming service.
None of the streaming services have my entire collection, anyway.

Here, I don't make any distinction between my "absolute favorites" and the bands
that I've listened to a few times, enjoyed it, and then moved on. My favorites
change all the time, anyway. It's very hard to categorize like that.

I give my favorite albums, where I have any. But sometimes, those are just the
albums that I happened to listen to. I don't always listen to the entire
discography (who does, lol). I use a 💿 emoji where I've listened to the band's
discography and can confidently say which albums are my favorites. But it
doesn't necessarily mean that these are my favorite bands.

The bands are ordered roughly by similarity.

## ChatGPT analysis

Here's a [ChatGPT
analysis](https://chatgpt.com/share/6875424c-cac4-8005-bf66-95eed037e571) of who
I am based on my taste. Because why not, lol.

Inspired by this post about [analysing
bookmarks](https://noperator.dev/posts/o3-pocket-profile/).

I stripped all my comments from the prompt and kept only a raw list of artists,
to avoid "leaking" my writing style.
