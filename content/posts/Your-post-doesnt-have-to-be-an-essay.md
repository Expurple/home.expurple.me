I get it. You don't want your blog to be a Twitter shitpost. You want to
research the topic. You want to cover it well, from many angles, anticipating
potential counter-arguments. You want to be objective. You want to write
detailed disclaimers that highlight the limitations. You want your posts to be
accessible. You want your posts to be useful.

"You" are me. I struggle to publish anything because of this perfectionism.

But short, subjective,
[high-context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-context_and_low-context_cultures)
posts can still be useful. They can still communicate ideas. It's as simple as
that.

You don't have to manually write out every proof, every bit of context. Your
readers have their entire life experience as context. If your idea is good, some
readers will just *recall* their own examples and proofs. You don't *have to*
put in the huge effort and convince all the others. There's nothing wrong with
attempting that, but realize that this isn't the only approach. Paradoxically,
you may reach more people if you post "underdeveloped" ideas but do so more
often.
