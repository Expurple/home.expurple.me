I love storing things and then being able to access them later. I love making
the access easy.

That's probably one of the reasons why programming speaks to me.

I love adding links between Jira tasks. Leaving knowledge breadcrumbs. Code
comments. Hyperlinks.

I love refactoring code, although this can be an endless pointless circle.
Nowadays, I try to delay refactoring until there's some real-world pain to be
solved.

I love being concise, though I don't always succeed.

## Storing stuff

I still have pretty much all music and poems I've written since I was 12. It's
not a direct lineage, sometimes I lost my stuff and had to recover a lot from
DMs. But now, the setup should be pretty solid.

It's a folder that's synced to a managed Nextcloud instance, accessible from a
browser. That folder isn't very large, but has accumulated a lot of useful
files.

I have all code that I've written over the last 5 years (i.e. since I started
coding).

I have a [dotfile](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles) repository, where
I also put my scripts and various notes to help myself set up a new machine:

- a list of software to install
- a list of settings to click through
- instructions for rare occasions, such as updating a live USB

I save my shell history and browsing history. "Shell history is your best
productivity tool" [^1]

I have 5 years of diary in [Daylio](https://daylio.net/) and 3 years of all my
income/expenses in Excel. This is useful when we wonder or argue about something
with my girlfriend üòÅ

Surely, I also save my documents, resumes, and medical records.

When I read an article and like it, I
[download](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile) it. It's nice to be
able to quickly [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) (or even just
manually skim) that folder when I've vaguely remembered a good quote or idea. I
guess, googling can also work, but sometimes it doesn't work as well in my
experience. And small random blogs can disappear at any moment.

As I was creating this site, these downloaded articles also proved useful as
examples of good look and feel. I guess, if I had these as a list of
links/bookmarks, this would work too. The point is: keeping this list (whether
downloaded or not) was useful.

I stream music rather than download it, but I have a text file with a list of
around 150 of my favorite albums. It's really convenient to share with someone
who doesn't know what to listen to, or when I'm looking for examples of a
specific vibe. I want to share it here when I figure out how to integrate it
best.

Of course, I have an even larger file with music that I **plan** to listen to.
And similar ones for movies, books, and blogs.

I take pictures and write short notes/reviews of guitars, headphones,
smartphones, and laptops that I own. I want to publish the guitars here at some
point. On the other hand, I rarely write "normal" reviews like on Google Maps.

I probably spent too much time reordering these paragraphs.

## Access

I really love the idea of having a central "hub" for my public social accounts
and media, that's why I made this site.

I always planned to eventually add a blog to it, but I didn't have any good post
ideas until I started putting together the [home page]({{< ref "/" >}}) with all
the social links. That's when I had this realization about its purpose and my
tendency to store and organize things.

To be fair, this post has only touched on "storing" stuff, rather than
"organizing" or "accessing" it. Having a structure that makes sense is very
important. That's what allows you to actually come back and use your files
instead of indulging in useless digital hoarding. But I'm having trouble coming
up with an underlying principle other than "have a directory structure that
makes sense to you" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Maybe, I'll describe mine later in more detail.
