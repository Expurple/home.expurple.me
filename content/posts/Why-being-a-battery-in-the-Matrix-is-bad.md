The machines are going to kill you as soon as they find a better energy source.
That's the real reason.

The machines are going to "lay off" some of the humans if the energy demands
fall.

You're just a battery. That's an inherently passive and vulnerable position.

If the choice really was between the dangers of the outside world and staying
comfortable and protected within the Matrix, then staying in the Matrix would be
perfectly reasonable!

But the truth is: if you ignore the outside world, you can't know whether you're
actually protected, and how long it will last.

I believe it's this paranoid self-preservation instinct that pushes us to the
outside. The search for truth is not irrational. It serves an important purpose.

If you don't actively seek the truth, eventually you just face it. Unprepared.

Sometimes, it means that you die.

I came up with this wording while listening to Noam Chomsky [talk about
distractions](https://youtu.be/u9trTzH0zkE). It's a good talk.

Then, after an enjoyable 18 minutes of listening to it, I looked at the comments
and found out that it's an AI voice reading some AI summary of his works ðŸ¤¯

I'm not closely familiar with his works or his voice, so it sounded very
believable. Moreover, the story is coherent and persuasive. It's the most
coherent AI text that I've seen so far. I can still recommend this video for its
easy-to-digest format.

Living in 2025 is so weird.
